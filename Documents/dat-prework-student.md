# Getting Started with Data Science

Welcome to Data Science at General Assembly!

We're all really excited that you're joining the General Assembly community. In order to ensure your success in the course, we’ve created a pre-work checklist that will take most students between 10-15 hours to complete. 

Please complete these pre-work items before your first day so that both you and your computer will be prepared for class. In the meantime, feel free to reach out with any questions (or just to say hi)!

### Installation
Please follow the installation instructions below. If your installation is not complete or if you have any problems, plan to arrive at least 30 minutes early to the first class so that our TAs' can help you get set up!

1. [ ] Install [Python 2.7](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
        - *Note: Make sure to install version 2.7, NOT Python 3, which has significant differences from 2.7 and is not “industry standard.” We will be using Python 2.7.*
2. [ ] Install [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads)
        - Follow the installation instructions for your computer (e.g. “Mac Install”). 
        - Test that Anaconda and Python were installed correctly. For example, on a Mac you can by open a Terminal window (or the Anaconda Launcher app on your desktop) and type `ipython notebook`. If successful, in a few moments, your browser should open to a window titled "Jupyter."

### Start Practicing
Review the following resources as an introduction to some commonly used concepts and tools.

1. [ ] Complete Codecademy's free ["Learn Python"](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/python) course to practice your Python syntax. Pay close attention to lists, dictionaries, and functions.
    - Bonus Option: Check out [Learn Python the Hard  Way](http://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/) and work through exercises 1-10.

2. [ ] Review our [Command Line](http://generalassembly.github.io/prework/cl/#/) tutorial to familiarize yourself with basic Terminal commands. Pay particular attention to folder navigation and file creation.
    - Bonus Option: Run through these additional exercises from [Learn Command Line the Hard Way](http://cli.learncodethehardway.org/book/).

3. [ ] Read through this [10 minute guide to Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/10min.html) to learn about a popular library used for data analysis that we will be using in this course.
    - Bonus Option: Practice your Python by working through [Project Euler's computational problems](https://projecteuler.net).
