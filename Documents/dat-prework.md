# Getting Started with Data Science

Welcome to Data Science at General Assembly!

We're all really excited that you're joining the General Assembly community. In order to ensure your success in the course, we’ve created a pre-work checklist that will take most students between 10-15 hours to complete. 

Please complete these pre-work items before your first day so that both you and your computer will be prepared for class. In the meantime, feel free to reach out with any questions (or just to say hi)!

## Pre-Course Checklist
Please complete the following by the first day of class. Feel free to shoot us an email with any questions:

### Schedule
- [ ] Add the following information to your calendars:
* **Time**: (Time)
* **Meeting days**: (Days)
* **Start date**: (Date)
* **End date**: (Date)
* **Location**: (Address)
* **Classroom**: (Number)

### Introductions
1. [ ] Fill out this [Student Profile Survey] in order for us to get to know you.
2. [ ] Complete this [Preliminary Skills Survey] in order to help us place you in complementary groups.

### Accounts
1. [ ] Create a Github account, if you don't already have one.

### Installations
Please follow the installation instructions below. If your installation is not complete or if you have any problems, plan to arrive at least 30 minutes early to the first class so that our TAs' can help you get set up!

1. [ ] Install [Python 2.7](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
        - *Note: Make sure to install version 2.7, NOT Python 3, which has significant differences from 2.7 and is not “industry standard.” We will be using Python 2.7.*
2. [ ] Install [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads)
        - Follow the installation instructions for your computer (e.g. “Mac Install”). 
        - Test that Anaconda and Python were installed correctly. For example, on a Mac you can by open a Terminal window and type `ipython notebook`. If successful, in a few moments, your browser should open to a window titled "Jupyter."

### Start Practicing (Optional)
Here are a few optional resources that will help introduce you to some commonly used syntax and tools. Feel free to work through them if needed.

1. Complete Codecademy's free ["Learn Python"](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/python) lesson to practice your Python syntax.
    - Bonus Option: Check out [Learn Python the Hard  Way](http://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/) and work through exercises 1-10.

2. Review our [Command Line](http://generalassembly.github.io/prework/cl/#/) tutorial to familiarize yourself with Terminal commands.
    - Bonus Option: Run through these additional exercises from [Learn Command Line the Hard Way](http://cli.learncodethehardway.org/book/).

3. Read through this [10 minute guide to Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/10min.html), a popular library used for data analysis.
    - Bonus Option: Practice your Python by working through [Project Euler's computational problems](https://projecteuler.net).

### Additional Resources (Optional)
Consider the following reading recommendations.  These are not required but may help supplement your learning experience:

  * [The Quick Python Book](http://www.amazon.com/Quick-Python-Book-Second-Edition/dp/193518220X)
  * [Data Analysis With Open Source Tools](http://www.amazon.com/Data-Analysis-Open-Source-Tools/dp/0596802358)
