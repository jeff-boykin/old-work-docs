Website: [Course Info](http://www.thisismetis.com/data-science)

**Admissions:** ?

**Pre-Work:**
- initial software setup
- productivity with the command line
- using an editor effectively
- Python basics
- a set of readings with exercises that blend the statistical and computational. 
- Metis teaching assistants review these preparatory exercises and provide feedback online.

**Structure:** 5 Projects
Data science projects can be divided into useful dimensions. A dimension can be thought of as a facet along which a decision must be made to specify a project implementation. The bootcamp considers the dimensions of **domain, design, data, algorithms, tools, and communication**. Each Unit covers certain content from several domains, which are reinforced in that Unit's project.

- [ ] **Project 1** - 
  - Context = MTA dataset to guide marketing street teams. 
  - Provided w datasets for exploratory data analysis and plotting. 
  - Small groups.
- [ ] **Project 2** - 
  - Context = Movie industry predictions. 
  - Topic = Guided scraping w machine learning prediction via regression models. 
  - Individual work.
- [ ] **Project 3** - 
  - Context = Insurance industry. 
  - Topic = supervised learning algorithms, relational databases, classification models. D3 visualization & Python Flask API framework (serve data to support visuals). 
  - Small groups.
- [ ] **Project 4** - 
  - No context given. 
  - Topic = Unsupervised learning / NLP algorithms, NoSQL databases, API data collection. 
  - Individual work; few constraints.
- [ ] **Project 5** - 
  - Context
  - Topic
  - Workflow
