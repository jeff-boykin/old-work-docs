# Getting Started with Data Science

Welcome to Data Science at General Assembly!

We're all really excited that you're joining the General Assembly community. In order to ensure your success in the course, weâ€™ve created a pre-work checklist that will take most students between 10-15 hours to complete. 

Please complete these pre-work items before your first day so that both you and your computer will be prepared for class. In the meantime, feel free to reach out with any questions (or just to say hi)!

### Introductions
1. [ ] Fill out this [Student Profile Survey] in order for us to get to know you.
2. [ ] Complete this [Preliminary Skills Survey] in order to help us place you in complementary groups.

### Accounts
1. [ ] Create a Github account, if you don't already have one.

### Installations
Please follow the instructions below. If you have any problems, come to class ~30 min early on the first day and our TAs will help you get set up:

1. [ ] Install Python
    - Follow the installation instructions [from this link](https://www.python.org/downloads/) to install Python 2.7 on your computer. 
        - *Note: Make sure to install version 2.7, NOT Python 3. Currently, version 2.7 is the general industry standard.*
2. [ ] Install Anaconda
    - Follow the instructions [from this link](https://www.continuum.io/downloads) to download and install Anaconda, a popular set of Python tools used for data science.
        - If you get stuck, try reading the [documentation](http://docs.continuum.io/anaconda/install.html).
3. [ ] Test for Successful Install
    - Test that Anaconda is installed correctly by opening a Terminal window and entering:

    ```ipython notebook```

If successful, in a few moments, your browser should open to a window titled "Jupyter."

### Start Practicing (Optional)
Here are a few optional resources that will help introduce you to some commonly used syntax and tools. Feel free to work through them if needed.
