##Data Science v2 - Student-Facing Repo Template

This is a template for creating a student-facing repository for your DAT instance. This is __not__ the DAT curriculm. [You can find the FEWD Curriculum here](https://github.com/generalassembly-studio/FEWD_Curriculum). If you plan to use Schoology instead of GitHub, you can simply hit the "Download ZIP" button to the right and manually populate your Schoology instance with the files for each week.

For instructions on how to set up a student-facing GitHub repository for your DAT class, please see below.

> __IMPORTANT: Once you are done setting up your student-facing repo, either delete or overwrite the contents of this Readme file before distributing this repo to students!__

##Setting Up Your Student-Facing Repo

In DAT, we will use a student-facing repo to distribute things like homework and project prompts, sample and solution code, slides and notes. The instructor or producer should create a student-facing repo for their course by following these steps:

* Before you get started, you'll need to know what your instructors' and TAs' GitHub usernames are. They should already have GitHub accounts but if they don't, they'll need to sign up for one. Instructor/TA onboarding is a great time to ask for their GitHub handles. 

* If you've never used GitHub before, [watch this video](https://generalassembly.wistia.com/medias/jkrycndgrs) and follow all the steps. By the end of the video you should 1.) have a GitHub account; 2.) have installed and configured your GitHub for Mac/Windows desktop application; 3.) know how to create a new repository and add files to it. If you run into any problems or need a refresher, [check out this guide](https://github.com/generalassembly-studio/FEWD_Curriculum/blob/master/Week_00_GitHub/Getting_Started_With_GitHub.pdf), which covers the same material as the video.

* Once you're comfortable with GitHub, create a new repo under the [ga-students org](https://github.com/ga-students) (if you don't have access to ga-students, please email [Zoe](mailto:zoes@generalassemb.ly), who can add you). Name your repo using the following convention: DAT-City-Instance Number (i.e. "DAT-NYC-3"). Make sure that you select "Private" in order to prevent your course materials from being publicly accessible.

* Press the "Download ZIP" button to the right. Download the .zip file to your computer. Open up the folder called "DAT-Student-Facing-Repo-Template". Copy all of the files inside of this folder into your 'DAT-City-Instance Number' folder (i.e. your local copy of the GitHub repo you just created). Complete the steps outlined in the video and guide to 1.) leave a commit message; 2.) commit and sync your changes; 3.) publish your changes. Your class repo should now be up on GitHub!

* You'll now need to give your instructors access to the repository by [creating a new team](https://github.com/orgs/ga-students/teams) and adding both the instructor and the TA to the team. Give your team the same name that you gave the repo above, plus the word "Instructors" (i.e. "DAT-NYC-3 Instructors"). Then, under "Repositories," add the repo that you just created by searching for its name in the "Add repositories" field. Finally, press the "Settings" button on the left and select "Admin Access". This will allow your instructors to make changes to the repo.

* Your instructors should receive an email notification from GitHub letting them know that they've been given access to this repo but just in case they don't, you can always send them the link. Navigate to [https://github.com/ga-students](https://github.com/ga-students) in your web browser, search for your repo by name in the "Find a repository..." search box and click on the title for your repo. This is the permalink for your repository that you can send to instructors and students. 

* When adding students to the repo, do the same as above, creating a team for students (i.e. "DAT-NYC-3 Students"). Instead of giving students admin access to the repo, give them read access. This way, students can't accidentally write over any files in the repo. __Producers will need to add students to this group because instructors do not have the necessary permissions to add students.__ You will need to ask students to send you their GitHub account names either before the start of class or during the first week so that you can add them. 

* Your student-facing repo should now be ready to use! __Instructors should be sure to either delete this readme file or overwrite it with relevant content before sending the link to students!__ Students can use the GitHub for Mac/Windows app to access the materials in the repo. There are instructions on how to do this as part of [FEWD's GitHub lesson](https://github.com/generalassembly-studio/FEWD_Curriculum/tree/master/Week_00_GitHub), if desired.
