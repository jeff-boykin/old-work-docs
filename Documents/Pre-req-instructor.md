#DAT Pre-Requisites

##Objectives

#### Task Objectives
*Before the first class, students should have already:*
- Installed Python (2.7)
- Installed Anaconda
- Created a github account


#### Learning Objectives
*Before the first class, students should be able to:*
- Define basic data types used in object-oriented programming
- Recall the Python syntax for lists, dictionaries, and functions
- Create files and navigate directories using the command line interface (for their specific environment)

#### Pre-work Goals:
*Before the first class, students should be able to:*

1. Utilize unix commands to navigate the file system and modify files
  - Summarize a basic filesystem structure, including absolute and relative paths
  - Use the most common commands to navigate and modify files / directories via the Terminal window.

2. Write programs that utilize the different data types
  - Describe the concept of a "data type" and how it relates to variables
  - Identify and define variable with the following data types: int, float, string, boolean, list, and dictionary
  - Write code that uses conditional statements to control the flow of a program
  - Declare, assign to, and manipulate data stored in a variable
  - Iterate over and and manipulate values in an array

3. Write functions that accepts a parameter and solves a problem
  - Describe how parameters and arguments relate to functions
  - Create and call a function that accepts parameters to solve a problem
  - Return a value from a function using the return keyword
  - Define and call functions 

4. Write for loops that iterate over arrays and loops
  - Create arrays and manipulate values in Arrays.
  - Describe why arrays are useful and how to use them effectively in Python
  - Write a “for” loop
  - Describe the difference between for and while statements

Issue: People that know the math and just need to learn programming have a great time. Programmers who are good at picking up math can do ok too. People who have either computer or science backgrounds also have stronger analytic skills. 

Admissions needs to do more to reset expectations 

* Persona problem: Strugglers tend to have liberal arts backgrounds, no (recent) math/science knowledge.
* Persona problem: Background of strugglers is indicator, regardless of whether they are QA testers in tech or service workers. 
* Persona of quitter: Someone who was admitted without enough time to complete the prework. Lack of preparation and fast on-ramp to curriculum meant that the student quit the course.
* Persona of complainer: Need to reset their expectations about curriculum scope


1. **Technical Issues**
* IF WIN 7 x64 bit specifically, Anaconda *won't* work. Should work with most other version of windows.
* Will need alternate version of windows or run a VM with alternate windows environment.
* Make a cut-off of Mac & Windows versions

2. PT Needs Installfest
- Prior to day 1
Python 2.7
Anacondas (see list of incompatible operating systems)
Check for ability to run: matplotlib, seaborne, numpy, scipy, sklearn, etc. 

Create an ipython notebook that runs all the plugins and have the students run it as a CHECK to see if everything is installed correctly.

**Prework**
* Checking for statistical / math familiarity:
* EX: Do they know what a 'log' function is?
  * If YES = AWESOME. Now review Khan Academy Probability and Statistics
  * If NO = TAKE ANALYTICS / review Algebra II module in Khan Academy

**Curriculum Critique**

Lesson 6: Linear Regression is too advanced. Rsquared as missing topic. Ridge & Lasso are too advanced and may need to be removed.
IDEA: Make Ridge/Lasso as "explore further"/advanced or bonus resources

(Independent Practice) Labs: revise timing & deliverables

1. Here is the main goal
2. Here are additional goals to keep advanced students busy for x time

Unit 1:
- Graph needs labels.

Unit 2: 
- Too much content? Too long, too advanced? Lots of mental leaps. Some sub-content is missing.
- Content needs prioritization
- We need more labels in the unit 2 notebooks.


IDEA: More review sessions
