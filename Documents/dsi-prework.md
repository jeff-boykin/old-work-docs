# Getting Started with Data Science

Welcome to Data Science at General Assembly!

We're all really excited that you're joining the General Assembly community. In order to ensure your success in the course, we’ve created a pre-work checklist that will take most students between 10-15 hours to complete. 

Please complete these pre-work items before your first day so that both you and your computer will be prepared for class. In the meantime, feel free to reach out with any questions (or just to say hi)!

## Pre-Course Checklist
Please complete the following by the first day of class. Feel free to shoot us an email with any questions:

1. [Accounts](#account)
2. [Install](#install)
3. [Practice](#practice)
4. [Resources](#resources)

### Accounts
1. [ ] Create a Github account, if you don't already have one.

<a name="install"></a>
### Installation
Please follow the installation instructions below. If your installation is not complete or if you have any problems, plan to arrive at least 30 minutes early to the first class so that our TAs' can help you get set up!

1. [ ] Install [Python 2.7](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
        - *Note: Make sure to install version 2.7, NOT Python 3, which has significant differences from 2.7 and is not “industry standard.” We will be using Python 2.7.*
2. [ ] Install [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads)
        - Follow the installation instructions for your computer (e.g. “Mac Install”). 
        - Test that Anaconda and Python were installed correctly. For example, on a Mac you can by open a Terminal window (or the Anaconda Launcher app on your desktop) and type `ipython notebook`. If successful, in a few moments, your browser should open to a window titled "Jupyter."

### Start Practicing
Review the following resources as an introduction to some commonly used concepts and tools.

1. [ ] Complete Codecademy's free ["Learn Python"](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/python) course to practice your Python syntax. Pay close attention to lists, dictionaries, and functions.
    - Bonus Option: Check out [Learn Python the Hard  Way](http://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/) and work through exercises 1-10.

2. [ ] Review our [Command Line](http://generalassembly.github.io/prework/cl/#/) tutorial to familiarize yourself with basic Terminal commands. Pay particular attention to folder navigation and file creation.
    - Bonus Option: Run through these additional exercises from [Learn Command Line the Hard Way](http://cli.learncodethehardway.org/book/).

3. [ ] Read through this [10 minute guide to Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/10min.html) to learn about a popular library used for data analysis that we will be using in this course.
    - Bonus Option: Practice your Python by working through [Project Euler's computational problems](https://projecteuler.net).

### Additional Resources (Optional)
Consider the following reading recommendations. These are not required but may help supplement your learning experience:

  * [The Quick Python Book](http://www.amazon.com/Quick-Python-Book-Second-Edition/dp/193518220X)
  * [Data Analysis With Open Source Tools](http://www.amazon.com/Data-Analysis-Open-Source-Tools/dp/0596802358)
  * [Python for Data Analysis](http://www.amazon.com/Python-Data-Analysis-Wrangling-IPython/dp/1449319793)

DRAFT FROM DC

1. **Command Line Interface (CLI)**: If you're a complete beginner, [start here](http://go.toutapp.com/caba00b72428549af2). If you want to flesh out your skills, [go here](http://go.toutapp.com/dbdc25261d4f4496f0).

2. **Python**: If you're new to Python, start with this [free 13-hour short course on Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/python). If you want to flesh out your skills, go through the free online book [Learn Python The Hard Way](http://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/).

3. **Python + Data**: You will use the pandas library a lot during this course, therefore we strongly recommended you learn the basics before starting!

        - To understand what pandas is used for, [watch this 10-minute video](https://vimeo.com/59324550).
        - If you're entirely new to Python and tools like the IPython Notebook, I'd recommend [Python for Data Analysis by Wes McKinney](http://go.toutapp.com/de3ee8f0262f3f5765) (he actually *wrote* the pandas library). It starts from zero knowledge, introduces you to Python and the various tools of the trade, including numpy and pandas. It will leave you well prepared not just for the practical aspects of this course, but for actually doing data science in general!
        - If you're reasonably comfortable with Python, perhaps skip the book and jump straight into the [tutorial lessons here](http://go.toutapp.com/b8135737c710760fa0). This page also contains additional resources for advanced use cases.

4. **Stats**: Learn about statistical significance, confidence intervals, chi-square tests, Bayes' Theorem, and much more are in [Think Stats](http://go.toutapp.com/9e4c03d393653b9b07), a free book that uses real-world examples written in Python!

5. **Podcasts**: There is a plethora of excellent podcasts about data science. Learn about k-means while you clean, or about random walks on a random walk! [Data Skeptic](http://go.toutapp.com/823e867723e58f68c2) and [Linear Digressions](https://www.udacity.com/podcasts/linear-digressions) are two of our favourites.
