# Data Curriculum Chair Role

## Slack Thread 1

#### Current System: We have a baseline materials github repository with lesson plans, datasets, and rubrics on a set series of topics. Instructors frequently make edits/changes but don't normally contribute these back to baseline.

#### Proposed System: Two repositories - one as content library, one as exemplar pulling best material from library into a suggested sequence

Jeff Boykin [9:18 AM]
Well, to your point - without automated pulls, updating that content manually is a blocker. What structure would you find more helpful?

kiefer [9:18 AM]
Which isn’t anyone’s fault. I just think it would take **a dedicated person to be parsing and reorganizing that stuff across the different DSIs**

kiefer [9:21]
Anyway
the thing about the contributions is that *the different DSIs have some stuff that's the same and some stuff that's different*
and *i’m not sure how you would organize that without a dedicated person parsing it and compartmentalizing the material into useful structured folders/notebooks, etc*

[9:23]
If i were not teaching a DSI I would volunteer myself
since i love content

kiefer [9:25 AM]
Say we did have someone parsing it.
I think the ideal is to have a two-tier folder structure

[9:25]
Broad topic —> specific topic.
and then inside specific topics are the content made by different DSI courses

[9:26]
and then *a “master” version which would be maintained by this person that combines the best parts of the contributions*
ready for a class

Jeff Boykin [9:27 AM]
So a repo as database and another repo as exemplar (edited)

Richard Harris [9:27 AM]
I like that idea more

kiefer [9:28 AM]
I think DSI instructors should ideally have access to the contributions across DSIs - like now -
but also have *the master version continuously updated* according to improvements from those contributions

[9:29]
I think improvements to the course will happen quickest in genetic fashion, with crossover + mutation
crossover between DSIs and mutation via instructor’s improving their content

[9:30]
but unfortunately, to facilitate that crossover there needs to be *persistent management and updating of the course content*

[9:30]
**thats a full time job by an expert**

Richard Harris [9:30 AM]
And editing of said content

kiefer [9:30 AM]
yes

[9:31]
It’s basically *a DSI instructor who doesn’t teach, just manages all the content and keeps everything organized, edited, and up to date*
error checking, etc.


kiefer [9:34 AM]
It’s something I’d love to do, but will never have time to do, as DSIs are hard to teach. the classes are just too time consuming

> NOTE: Time spent teaching as pain point vs content editing & curation

## Slack Thread 2

Jonathan Balaban [9:34 AM]
I offered to do this in April

kiefer [9:35 AM]
Like on the side or full-time

Jonathan Balaban [9:36 AM]
As SME work, temp, but obviously things evolve so a full-time or regular gatekeeper would be huge.

kiefer [9:36 AM]
yeah
thats the ideal IMO
**full time editor**

kiefer [9:37 AM]
there are enough DSIs running full time now that *this person would literally have new content coming in every day*
to pull into the repo structure, adjust, add/subtract from master version, etc.

[9:38]
anyway
this is just my dream

[9:38]
but I do feel like the current system is going to end up with DSIs drifting further and further away from each other
since finding and adjusting content from other courses is currently too time-consuming

Jeff Boykin [9:40 AM]
So this is a problem with multiple layers. First the structure layer - how to setup curriculum for optimal use. Second the user (instructor) layer - how to navigate and identify supplemental material. Third the content curation layer - how to continuously bring in new/improved content. Fourth the operational layer - how to implement said curation organizationally - aka: let people know what has been changed/updated on an ongoing basis.

kiefer [9:42 AM]
Yeah - I think it’s possible despite the four layers
but again, it means *a full time job for a person with deep familiarity with the topics*
basically

[9:44]
It’s hard for me to imagine a way around that. If you have many different people working on it in small doses then consolidation is not going to happen
it would still be fragmented

> NOTE: CONSOLIDATION AS PAIN POINT


## Slack Thread 3

kiefer [9:52]
I don’t know web development, so I can’t weigh in on the WDI fragmentation specifically, but limiting fragmentation in the DSI I think is _particularly_ important because **more instructors are naturally coming in with specific expertise in some areas over others**

[9:53]
and *having that expertise pooled in an accessible way by a curriculum editor would actually make it feasible for the DSIs in different cities to teach other expert’s material without an unreasonable amount of searching and work*

[9:55]
It gets back to what I mentioned before: I find myself not even trying to go to the master branch to search for curriculum because I know it will take a long time to parse through, read it all, find out if there’s anything I like, and then make the necessary adjustments to fit it in to my class

[9:57]
Whereas the curriculum editor could have an index, readme files giving an overview of what the notebooks cover, or whatever, that would allow me to immediately find code and presentations that have been done
and the “consolidated” version that combines across versions in a consistent style

> NOTE: Dig deeper for pain point specifics from existing readme file structure here.

Richard Harris [10:07]
I like the idea of having a core set of polished work that we can draw on and then adapt to each market as needed

kiefer [10:08 AM]
yes
the polished work _and_ the organized, modularized raw work too

[10:09]
all in an easily navigable repo

> NOTE: Refers back to the previously mentioned two repo structure: Library + Exemplar
