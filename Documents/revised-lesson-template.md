> #### *Guiding Questions When Using This Template*
>
> - [ ] Are the learning objectives measurable?
>   - [ ] Are there between 2-5 learning objectives?*
>   - [ ] Are the learning objectives specific enough?
>   - [ ] Do these learning objectives help students work toward the unit project?
>
> - [ ] Are activities spaced out with enough time for each?
>   - [ ] Did you include knowledge "Checks" or activities at the end of every component to test comprehension?
>   - [ ] If reusing an existing resource, is there enough content for a given length of time?
>   - [ ] How will this lesson culminate? (final activity + conclusion)
>
> - [ ] Did you provide guidance for both students & instructors?
>   - [ ] What will instructors have to do to prepare for this lesson?
>   - [ ] What will students have to do to prepare for this lesson?

> #### *How to Use This Template*
> * Static Components: Reserve roughly 5 min for Opening, 5 unscheduled "buffer" mins for overrun, & at least 5 min for Conclusion (end of lesson review). 
> * Modular Components: The units of instruction are: Intro, Demo, Guided-Practice, & Independent-Practice. These can be cycled or intermixed in various orders, depending on the topic / content.


> #### *Your Audience*
> Keep in mind these DAT personas as you create and iterate on this lesson. Write out lessons in a student-facing voice for consistency.

> **Level up Lisa**
> Summary: She currently primarily uses Excel and SQL to do her data analysis.   She’s very excited to learn about predictive analysis but she doesn’t have the coding skills to really pick up these skills on her own.

> **Manager Matt**
> Summary: He currently does basic data analysis in Excel and SQL. He doesn’t necessarily want to build the models to answer those question but he wants to understand how models can help him answer those questions. Ultimately, he wants to make better managerial decisions because he understand more about the work his team is doing.
